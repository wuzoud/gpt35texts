Peter quickly realised he had superhuman strength, agility and speed. His spider-sense alerted him to danger. But with great power comes great responsibility.

As Spider-Man, he began to fight crime and injustice in Queens and beyond. Keeping his identity secret was certainly a challenge, but his spider-suit and mask did the trick. He also employed various gadgets such as web-shooters crafted out of special materials, grappling hooks, and the like.

It wasn’t until Peter encountered Norman Osborn, also known as the Green Goblin, that he realised just how dangerous it was to be Spider-Man. Norman Osborn was a ruthless industrial tycoon who went too far in his experiments and became a ruthless evil villain.

At this point, Spider-Man had graduated from high school but still wanted to protect the innocent people of New York. He fought alongside the Avengers in their various battles, as well as against their enemies like Doctor Octopus, Venom, and the Sinister Six.

His most challenging adversary, however, was the Green Goblin. The Goblin was powerful and violent, and had a deep hatred for Spider-Man. As the battles escalated, so did their hatred for each other. Unfortunately, Spider-Man’s beloved Aunt May became a victim of the Goblin’s wrath when he shot her with a deadly green energy blast. The blast nearly killed her, but she miraculously survived.

With the help of his friends and a newfound resolve, Spider-Man defeated the Green Goblin and restored peace to New York. He finally realised that he was doing what he was meant to do and that it was his responsibility to protect others.

As Spider-Man, Peter Parker has faced numerous other challenges and villains. From the Sinister Six to Doctor Doom, the Sanctums to Kraven the Hunter, he has always stood for justice. He also knowingly put himself at risk on many occasions and has given us the iconic phrase, “With great power comes great responsibility.”

Spider-Man has been one of Marvel’s most beloved and popular characters since his debut in 1962. Not only is he a great example of how one person can make a difference but he’s also an inspiring mentor to many young people. With his courageous, selfless and responsible deeds, Spider-Man has been an inspiring role model.

Despite experiencing a few misfortunes in his history, Peter Parker has always remained an optimist. His bright personality, strong morals and adventurous spirit have kept people enthralled. As a result, Spider-Man has become one of the most beloved heroes in the Marvel universe.
