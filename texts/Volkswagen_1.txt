Volkswagen has a long and winding history. The company, known around the world today, got its start in 1937 in Germany under the direction of the Nazi party. Initially, Volkswagen was founded to produce a “people’s car”, a vehicle that was affordable for all Germans.

The company was founded by the German Labour Front, a Nazi organisation, with backing from prominent Nazi figures such as Joseph Goebbels. The company used its resources to create the iconic Beetle, the Volkswagen Type 1. The Beetle, also known as the “people’s car”, was designed by Ferdinand Porsche and was initially mass-produced for Nazi officers.

At the end of World War II, the Allied Powers put in place a plan known as the Marshall Plan to help rebuild Germany after the war. As part of the plan, Volkswagen was given to the British Military Government, which quickly sought a way to turn the company into a profitable enterprise. In 1949, the British appointed Heinz Nordhoff as the CEO of Volkswagen, and he implemented a production system similar to what Henry Ford had implemented on the Model T: mass production. This allowed the company to become much more efficient and create a car that was more affordable.

Nordhoff also aggressive marketed the Volkswagen Beetle, and it soon became a popular car in North America and Europe. In fact, the Beetle eventually became the world’s best-selling car of all time.

After Nordhoff passed away in 1968, Volkswagen sought to expand its portfolio with the launches of cars such as the Scirocco, Golf, and Jetta. During the 1980s, Volkswagen took a risk when it launched the water-cooled engine design which replaced the air-cooled design that had been used on the Beetle for decades. The risk paid off as the new engine dramatically increased power, performance, and reliability.

At the same time, Volkswagen also began expanding its offerings with the launch of the Vanagon in 1980. The Vanagon was Volkswagen’s first foray into the growing SUV segment. The launch was successful, and Volkswagen soon followed up with the hugely popular Passat, Polo, and Lupo.

The 1990s saw the launch of the iconic Volkswagen New Beetle and its successful follow-up, the Volkswagen Golf. The Golf was an instant success due to its sporty looks and efficient engine. The Golf was also the first Volkswagen car to offer fuel-injection, making it even more efficient.

By the 2000s, Volkswagen had become a well-respected brand that proved to be popular both in Europe and in North America. This popularity was solidified with the launch of the Volkswagen Touareg in 2006 and the hugely successful Audi TT in 2008. Volkswagen also continued to expand its portfolio with the launch of the Volkswagen Jetta and its Pagoda-styled Jetta SportWagon in 2009.

Today, Volkswagen remains one of the world’s most recognizable car companies. They continue to design and manufacture cars that are efficient, stylish, and reliable. As Volkswagen moves forward, it has become one of the leading automakers and a symbol of quality and reliability.
