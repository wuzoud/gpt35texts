It is the capital of the Novosibirsk Region and also the third most populous city in Russia, after Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is the administrative center of the oblast and the Siberian Federal District. Novosibirsk is located at the geographical center of the Eurasian continent, on the banks of the larger Ob River, and is the second largest Russian oblast in the easternmost portion of the West Siberian Plain.

Historically, Novosibirsk was populated by the Tatar people, the first Russian settlers in 1771, the Cossacks in 1824, and later by Russian and German immigrants. After the October Revolution of 1917, the city was declared Novosibirsk Oblast. From its beginning as a small trading post to its growth as an industrial center with more than one million inhabitants, Novosibirsk is one of the primary centres of higher education in all of Russia, housing five universities, dozens of research institutes, and thousands of students.

Novosibirsk is filled with beautiful architecture, monuments and sites. The famous Lenin Square is the largest urban square in Russia and the main square of the city. This is where you will find the iconic Lenin Monument, the main office buildings of the city and the train station. The Felix Dzerzhinsky Monument is another prominent feature in Novosibirsk; this is the monument of the founder of the KGB and is located in the popular Theater Square across the street from the Lenin Monument.

Novosibirsk is also home to a number of interesting cultural events, including traditional theatre performances and concerts featuring various types of music. The Bolshoi Theater of Novosibirsk is a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, as it hosts a variety of festivals and shows throughout the year, ranging from theater to rock concerts. The town also has a vibrant art scene, featuring galleries, fairs and exhibitions of local and international artists.

The Novosibirsk Oblast contains one of the largest reserves of untouched nature in the world. Within this vast region, visitors will be able to witness some of the oldest forests in Europe, as well as various types of wildlife including lynx, wolves, reindeer and bears. The Altai Mountains cover a large portion of the region and are great for scientist and adventurers alike.

The whimsical architecture of the Railway Station is another must-see. Built at the turn of the century, this magnificent building is an example of the Russian Classical Revival style.

Just outside of Novosibirsk, there are plenty of options for outdoor exploration.
