Tarot cards are a form of divination that has been used for centuries. Tarot cards are typically a set of 78 cards divided into two main sets: Major Arcana and Minor Arcana. Each card contains an illustration and a meaning associated with it. The 78 cards represent a variety of topics, from everyday life to spiritual depths, and can be used as a form of divination.

The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards, representing the main issues of a person’s life. In a Tarot reading, the Major Arcana usually provide information about a person’s current life situation and offer guidance as to what the future may hold.

The Minor Arcana consists of 56 cards, and typically represents more day-to-day life situations. The Minor Arcana can provide information about relationships, health, career, and other day-to-day topics.

The History of Tarot Cards

The history of Tarot cards is shrouded in mystery, making it difficult to know the exact origin of the cards. Most experts believe that Tarot cards originated in ancient Egypt, and have evolved over time. It is thought that the first Tarot cards were used in the 14th century by the Visconti-Sforza family to play a game similar to modern-day bridge.

It wasn’t until the 18th century that Tarot cards started to be used as a form of divination. There have been various interpretations of the cards over the centuries, and different decks have been created with their own distinct artwork and symbolism.

How to Read Tarot Cards:

When reading Tarot cards, there are several steps that should be taken in order to get the most out of the reading. First, set your intention, or the reason for your reading. Then, select your deck, or the set of cards you are going to use for your reading. It is best to choose a deck that resonates with you.

Once a deck has been chosen, it is time to shuffle and cut the cards. Shuffling the cards helps to mix up the energy of the deck, while cutting the cards helps to focus the tarot reading. 

Next, draw the cards. Most readings will require between 3 and 5 cards, depending on the particular question or situation the reading is intended to address. The cards should be laid out in a specific pattern, such as the Celtic Cross or the Three Card spread, in order to provide deeper insight into the situation.

Once the cards have been laid out, it is time to interpret them. Depending on how the cards are laid out, there may be a particular combination of cards that resonate with each other, providing clues as to what the reading is trying to tell you. Each card has its own unique meaning, and each card in a combination of multiple cards will help to interpret the overall message of the reading.

Tarot Card Ethics:

When working with Tarot cards, it is important to remember the basic ethical principles that should be followed. Tarot readers should be respectful, professional, and honest with their clients when offering readings. Clients should be aware that the results of a reading should not be taken as absolute truth, and should be open-minded when considering the outcome of a reading.

Reading Tarot cards can be a fun and engaging activity. If used with proper ethics, Tarot cards can help to provide insight into life’s difficult situations, and open up a doorway to a more enlightened life.
