From its beginnings in the medieval period, it has developed into something that is both traditional and modern, combining fresh ingredients with classic methods of preparation. From hearty soups to delicate pies, the flavors of Russia can be found in almost every corner of the world.

Today, Russian cuisine is known for its bold flavors and hearty textures. Many recipes start with a basic -- but often flavorful -- ingredient such as onions, garlic, potatoes, or cabbage. These ingredients are then combined with spices such as bay leaves, dill, or parsley, with meats including beef and pork, and with fish, seafood, mushrooms, and berries. Fresh fruit such as apples, pears, and plums are also incorporated to create beautiful and delicious dishes.

The most iconic and traditional of all Russian dishes is probably borscht, a Beetroot soup. This hearty and flavorful offering can be found throughout Russia. It typically contains the aforementioned ingredients and spices, alongside beets and pickles, and depending on the region, can also be served with dumplings, sour cream, and boiled potatoes. It’s the perfect combination of flavors and textures and is a must-try for anyone in the country.

Another treat unique to Russia is pelmeni, or dumplings. These can be filled with meat, fish, mushrooms, vegetables, and sometimes potatoes. They are often served with melted butter and a sauce made with garlic, onion, and sour cream. Pelmeni can also be boiled or fried, creating an even more interesting and savory flavor.

Russian cuisine wouldn't be complete without mentioning Sokha, a dish that revolves around smoked fish. This specialty includes smoked herring and salmon, and is served with pickles and onion. The fish is then usually mashed together with potatoes and served with a cream sauce. Sokha is a favorite of many throughout the country and is a dish that can be enjoyed for a quick meal or part of a larger dinner.

Kholodets, or aspic, is a gelatinous dish made from beef or pork stock, with diced meats and vegetables suspended within. This classic dish is served as a cool salad at many occasions and can even be prepared with fish, mushrooms, or vegetables. It is an interesting conversation starter as it is quite unexpected.

No discussion of Russian cuisine would be complete without mentioning their variety of delicious pies. Pirozhki are often served as a street food, and are small pocket pies. These are filled with cabbage, mushrooms, mashed potatoes, or other ingredients, and can be served hot or cold. These small pockets of deliciousness are some of the most popular items on the streets of Russia.

Yet another popular item is Kvass. This is a naturally fermented drink that tastes a bit like a beer and is made with bread, yeast, and sugar. It is very popular in the summer months and is sure to refresh you when you need it most.

Russian cuisine is incredibly diverse and unique and is sure to please both vegetarians and meat eaters. The flavors evolve from bold and hearty meats to delicate pastries, and the ingredients range from fresh seafood to vibrant vegetables. There is something for every taste, and its popularity is sure to continue to grow.
