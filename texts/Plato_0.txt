His real name was Aristocles, however he was given the nickname Plato ("Plato" means "broad-shouldered"), due to his broad shoulders. Plato wrote extensively on the subject of philosophy and is known for establishing the foundation of Western philosophy, with his Republic being one of his most renowned works.

Plato was a student of several other famous philosophers, such as Socrates and Parmenides. He was also influenced by the work of the pre-Socratic philosophers, such as Pythagoras and Heraclitus. Plato, being an avid student, devoted much of his life to pursuit of philosophical knowledge. Despite his privileged background, Plato was quite the innovator, contributing a number of influential and groundbreaking ideas to the field of philosophy.

One of the main features of Plato's works is his search for the true nature of reality. He believed that the world of sense - the world of perception – was not the real world, but a copy of a higher, more perfect world. This higher world was the world of Forms, or the world of ideas. The belief in the existence of this higher world led Plato to posit the concept of the divine, and this was also where his famous doctrine of "the forms" originates. According to his theory, the Forms were eternal and abstract objects, governed by a good and perfect mind. Furthermore, he believed that this higher world was the source of knowledge and the ultimate source of the good.

Plato's theory of forms was incredibly influential, and has been adopted by many other philosophers throughout history. Plato also pioneered the philosophical schools of thought known as Socratic and Platonic dialogues. In these dialogues, Socrates (Plato's teacher, who he represented) would not directly teach, but rather have the interlocutors in the dialogue discuss and give their opinion on certain issues. The purpose of this was to encourage each participant to examine their own beliefs, and, perhaps, to come to a conclusion regarding the topics that were discussed. This educational style has been adopted by modern schools and universities, in various forms.

Another of Plato's main contributions the field of philosophy was his political philosophy. His masterpiece, The Republic, is often considered to be the first great work of political philosophy, outlining a utopia that would be a perfectly ruled and just city ruled by the wisest individuals. This work, besides outlining Plato's beliefs regarding the structure and organization of a perfect society, which covered the topics of justice, authority, education and the proper distribution of resources, also introduced the notion of the tripartite soul and the allegory of the cave.

Furthermore, Plato's epistemology – the study of knowledge, is also quite renowned. His views on knowledge and truth were quite ahead of his time, and many of his theories are still relevant today. In particular, he questioned the notion of absolute certainty, instead arguing that knowledge was partial, and rooted in the beliefs of the beholder. He argued against the opinion that knowledge stemmed from the senses, believing that knowledge was a form of reminiscence, or recollecting what had been acquired and hidden in the soul prior to birth.

All in all, Plato's influence on philosophy has been immense, and is still reflected in modern philosophical discourse. It is fair to say that his belief in a higher reality, and the notion that justice is the fundamental principle of a society are still widely accepted today. He also contributed greatly to the development of Western philosophy, and he and his works have formed the basis of philosophical knowledge throughout the centuries to date.
