It is characterised by a focus on capturing the fleeting, sensory and emotional impressions of a subject, rather than its precise details. This movement emerged as a response to the traditional academic style of painting that emphasised precise details and realistic representations of subject matter.

The term "impressionism" was derived from a derogatory comment by the art critic, Louis Leroy, who reviewed the first exhibition of impressionist paintings in 1874. He compared the loose brushstrokes and unconventional compositions to "impressions" rather than finished works of art, hence the name "impressionism" was coined.

The primary goal of the impressionist artists was to convey the effects of the constantly changing light and atmosphere on the subjects they depicted. They were fascinated by the interplay of light and shadow and sought to capture the transience of nature through their paintings. They often painted en plein air, or outdoors, to capture the natural light and colors of their surroundings.

One of the most prominent figures of the impressionist movement was Claude Monet, who is often considered the father of Impressionism. His iconic painting, "Impression, Sunrise" (1872), gave the movement its name and perfectly embodies the essence of impressionism. Monet's use of loose brushstrokes and bright colors to capture the light and atmosphere of a sunrise was a departure from the traditional style of painting at the time.

Another key figure in the movement was Pierre-Auguste Renoir, known for his vibrant and lively depictions of everyday scenes. His paintings often featured happy and relaxed figures, reflecting the leisurely lifestyle of the bourgeoisie in 19th century France. Renoir's use of bold color and loose brushstrokes also became a hallmark of impressionist art.

While Monet and Renoir were considered the leaders of the impressionist movement, there were many other notable artists who contributed to its development and success. Edgar Degas was known for his depictions of ballet dancers and horse races, often captured in motion with his signature sense of spontaneity. Camille Pissarro, a mentor to many of the younger artists in the group, explored rural landscapes and peasants in his paintings. And Berthe Morisot, one of the few female artists of the movement, depicted intimate scenes of women and children with a delicate touch.

The impressionists faced great resistance and criticism from the traditional art world, who saw their works as unfinished and lacking in skill. The Salon, the official art exhibition of the French Academy, rejected their works, forcing the impressionists to hold their own exhibitions to gain recognition and support. Despite this, the impressionists persevered and continued to attract a passionate following, laying the foundation for modern art.

The techniques and innovations of the impressionists paved the way for future movements such as post-impressionism, fauvism, and expressionism. Their emphasis on capturing the sensations and feelings evoked by a subject, rather than a perfect representation of it, revolutionized the art world and challenged the conventional ways of seeing and painting.

One of the most significant innovations of impressionism was the use of vibrant, pure colors. Instead of mixing colors on the palette, the impressionists applied bold strokes of pure, unmixed color directly onto the canvas. This technique, known as "broken color" or "optical mixing," allowed the viewer's eye to blend the colors and create a sense of movement, making the paintings appear more alive and dynamic.

Another innovative technique used by the impressionists was the use of visible brushstrokes. Unlike traditional painting, where the artist strives to hide individual brushstrokes, the impressionists used visible brushstrokes to add texture and energy to their paintings. This captured the immediacy of the moment and added a sense of spontaneity to their works.

Furthermore, the impressionists broke away from the traditional rules of composition and perspective. They experimented with unconventional angles and compositions, such as cropping figures or objects out of the frame, to convey a sense of movement and energy. They also challenged the traditional notion of a single fixed viewpoint by depicting multiple perspectives within one painting.

The subject matter of impressionist art was also highly unconventional, as they focused on capturing everyday scenes and activities rather than grand historical or mythological themes. They captured the bustling streets of Paris, the serene landscapes of the French countryside, and intimate domestic scenes. This contrasted with the traditional art of the time, which often depicted royalty and biblical scenes.

The impressionists also pushed the boundaries of traditional gender roles in art. Women were often relegated to the role of models or muses in art at the time, but Berthe Morisot and other female impressionists challenged this by depicting their own lives and experiences in their paintings. This was a significant step towards achieving gender equality in the art world.

Today, impressionist art is widely celebrated and remains popular with audiences around the world. The movement's impact can be seen in various art forms, from painting to music and literature. The impressionists' emphasis on capturing the effects of light and atmosphere on a subject has influenced later movements such as expressionism and fauvism. Their unconventional techniques and subject matter challenged the traditional ways of creating and viewing art, paving the way for the modern art we know today.

In conclusion, impressionism was a groundbreaking movement that sparked a revolution in the art world. Its emphasis on capturing fleeting impressions, use of vibrant colors and visible brushstrokes, and unconventional subject matter challenged the conventions of traditional art and laid the foundation for modern art. The impressionists' ability to capture the essence and mood of a scene continues to inspire and captivate audiences, making their art timeless and relevant even today.
