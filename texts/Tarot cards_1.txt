So what exactly are Tarot cards? Tarot cards are decks of cards, usually containing 78 cards. These cards feature a variety of non-traditional yet powerful symbols that each carry specific meanings related to the person shuffling and interpreting them.

These symbols are from an ancient system of esoteric symbolism, created by gypsies and various occultists and mystics and practitioners through the ages. Each symbol has a story to tell, and Tarot is a way to unlock the power and truth of these stories, and translate them into personal guidance.

The 78 cards of Tarot are divided into the Major Arcana, consisting of 22 cards, and the Minor Arcana, which includes the 56 remaining cards. The Major Arcana cards represent the events that shape our lives. They are the signposts on our journey that can guide us to our ultimate destination.

These cards include characters like the Fool, the High Priestess, the Hermit, and the Empress. Each of these characters represent a point of view, leading to the ultimate resolution of the story. The Minor Arcana cards include symbols related to the four suits of Tarot – Cups, Pentacles, Swords, and Wands.

The Minor Arcana cards narrate stories related to their individual card, such as the Ace or the King of Pentacles, and can help you gain insight into the emotional, physical, and spiritual aspects of your life.

In traditional Tarot readings, the cards are shuffled and drawn in order to answer a specific question or to gain insight into a particular issue. When interpreted, the cards help the reader to look at the situation from a different perspective and gain clarity about the issue at hand.

Throughout a Tarot reading, it’s important to keep in mind the individual meaning of each card you’ve drawn. The narrative that forms as you draw cards from the deck can reveal clues and information about the focus of your question, and can provide invaluable guidance.

In addition to readings, the Tarot can be used for meditation and self-reflection. Carrying a daily card in your pocket or purse can be a great way to stay connected to your intuition and open yourself up to understanding the opportunities that surround you.

Tarot can also be used to help a person in times of distress or hardship. When faced with difficulty, consulting Tarot can provide you with the clarity to make positive decisions that will help you find your way out of the situation and back into the light.

No matter what your personal interests or goals may be, Tarot is a tool that can be used to enlighten, inspire, and empower you as you navigate your life’s journey. The wisdom found in the cards can help you gain a deeper understanding of yourself and the situations that are presented to you, giving you the strength to make the right choices for you.
