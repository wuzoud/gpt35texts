Despite their impressive biological makeup, one of the most astonishing facts about whales is their incredibly low rate of cancer.

In fact, it is estimated that only 5% of stranded whales have shown signs of cancer, while the rate among humans is around 20% (according to the American Cancer Society). This begs the question: why do whales have no cancer?

In order to understand this phenomenon, we must first take a closer look at the biology of whales. Whales are mammals, like humans, meaning they have a similar genetic and physiological makeup. However, whales have evolved in a way that allows them to thrive in the ocean's harsh and unpredictable environment.

This adaptation includes several unique characteristics that contribute to their low cancer rate. Let's explore these characteristics in more detail.

1. Slow Cell Division

Cell division is the process by which cells reproduce and multiply. In humans, this process is regulated by a protein called p53, known as the "guardian of the genome." When DNA is damaged or mutated, p53 activates the cell's repair process or initiates cell death to prevent the spread of mutation. However, whales have evolved to have a mutated version of the p53 protein that works at a much slower pace.

This slower cell division rate means that whales have fewer opportunities for genetic mutations to occur, reducing the risk of cancer development. Additionally, the slower rate of cell division also means that any mutations that do occur are less likely to spread and cause harm.

2. Tumor Suppressor Genes

Tumor suppressor genes are a group of genes that play a critical role in regulating cell growth and division. One of the most well-known and crucial tumor suppressor genes is the TP53 gene, which codes for the p53 protein. As previously mentioned, this protein helps prevent the spread of genetic mutations and ultimately cancer.

Whales have evolved to have multiple copies of this TP53 gene, giving them an advantage when it comes to controlling cell division and preventing cancer. This is a significant difference from humans, who only have one copy of the TP53 gene.

3. Large Size and Longevity

Whales are among the largest and longest-lived animals on the planet. The average lifespan of a whale can range from 80-100 years, with some species living even longer. This remarkable longevity can be attributed to several factors, one of which is their large size.

The large size of whales provides them with a significant advantage against cancer. As they age, the cells in their bodies must divide and multiply to sustain their massive size, increasing the likelihood of mutations. However, the unique characteristics mentioned earlier, such as slow cell division and multiple tumor suppressor genes, help to counter this risk.

Moreover, their large size also means that there are more cells in their bodies, making it more difficult for a cancerous cell to replicate and spread.

4. Unique Immune System

Another crucial factor in understanding why whales have such a low rate of cancer is their unique immune system. Whales have a complex and efficient immune system that has evolved to protect them from the harsh environment of the ocean.

One of the most significant differences between the immune systems of whales and humans is that whales do not have an inflammation response. Inflammation is a common immune response in humans that helps fight against infections and promotes healing. However, chronic inflammation can also contribute to the development of cancer.

Additionally, whales have a high concentration of immune cells called natural killer cells, which are responsible for identifying and attacking cancer cells. This high concentration of natural killer cells helps to keep cancer in check and prevent it from spreading.

5. Low Exposure to Environmental Toxins

Environmental toxins, such as pollution and chemicals, are known to increase the risk of cancer in humans. Whales, on the other hand, have limited exposure to these toxins due to their deep-sea habitat and their large size.

Their deep-sea habitat protects them from many environmental pollutants that are typically found near the surface of the ocean. Additionally, being at the top of the food chain means that they consume the least contaminated prey, further reducing their exposure to toxins.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the remarkably low rate of cancer in whales is a result of their unique evolutionary adaptations and biological makeup. Their slower cell division rate, multiple copies of tumor suppressor genes, large size, and efficient immune system all work together to greatly reduce their risk of developing cancer.

Studying these adaptations in whales can provide valuable insights into cancer prevention and treatment in humans. By understanding the factors that contribute to their low cancer rate, we can potentially develop new strategies and treatments for preventing and managing cancer.

Whales continue to amaze scientists and the general public alike with their incredible abilities and adaptations. Their low cancer rate is just another example of the wonders of the natural world, and it highlights the importance of conservation efforts to protect these magnificent creatures and their unique biology.
