The war lasted from July 28th, 1914 to November 11th, 1918 and was fought between the Allied Powers—Great Britain, France, Russia, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro, Romania, Japan, and the United States—and the Central Powers—Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, and Germany. It was a conflict of unprecedented scale and cost, with millions killed and wounded on both sides and with a lasting impact on the world.

The immediate causes of World War I can be traced back to two main events: the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, by a Serbian nationalist in 1914 and, shortly afterwards, the invasion of Belgium by Germany. The conflict quickly escalated with Russia entering the fray and the Central Powers rapidly expanding their control over much of Europe.

While the root causes of World War I have long been debated, most agree that the complex political and economic alliances of the era played a crucial role in creating a breeding ground for conflict. Austro-Hungary and Serbia were members of a group of European nations called the Triple Alliance, which included Germany. All three of these nations had long-standing disagreements, with Serbia and Austria-Hungary competing for power in the Balkans region and Germany trying to gain economic and military control of Central Europe.

These were further exacerbated by militarism, with many Europeans believing that war was the best and only option for resolving a political crisis. Entangled alliances and aggressive military posturing led to a large buildup of arms and equipment, as nations raced to purchase the latest technology and weaponry in an arms race between the major powers.

During the course of the war, these two sides employed a variety of strategies in an attempt to gain the upper hand. Each side used a variety of weapons, including machine guns, cannons, and tanks, as well as trench warfare, exacerbated by ever-advancing military technology. As the war progressed, new technologies were developed, such as chemical weapons, which caused horrific injuries and massive casualties.

In addition, the war was fought on both land and sea, with naval battles such as the Battle of Jutland, and battles fought at sea, frequently with blockades and strategic bombing campaigns. Most notoriously, the British blockade of Germany caused significant food shortages and was one of the causes of the collapse of the German Empire.

For the United States, World War I was a conflict of a far different scale than previous wars. Despite initially attempting to remain neutral in the conflict, the US was compelled to enter in 1917, when President Woodrow Wilson declared war on Germany in response to unrestricted submarine warfare, which threatened to cut off America’s vital supply of goods and munitions.

To support their entry into the war, the US began a large-scale mobilization effort, bringing over two million men to Europe to fight alongside the Allied forces. The new American forces, combined with the efforts of Britain and her allies, were eventually successful in finally bringing an end to the conflict in 1918.

When World War I came to a close, it had lasted more than four years and claimed more than 8 million lives, with a further 21 million wounded or missing, making it the most devastating war in human history. For many nations, the war resulted in border changes, economic and social upheaval, and a huge toll on human lives, yet it also paved the way for many of the post-war treaties, international laws, and organizations that we know today.
