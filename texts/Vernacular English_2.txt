Vernacular English is the dialect of language that is actually spoken by people of various regions and cultural groups, as opposed to the more formal standard English that is generally predetermined or prescribed. It is a form of vernacular, or informal, everyday spoken language in family, community, and social settings, and is considered to differ from the standard English of grade and middle school instruction. It’s characterized by casual grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary that, while possibly unintelligible to non-fluent speakers of standard English, is an entirely valid form of language that is becoming increasingly accepted in the English-speaking world.

The term “vernacular” can be traced back to the Latin words “vernaculum” or “vernaculus” which mean “native”. It also refers to a language or dialect spoken as ones mother tongue, or native language. Many of our everyday language patterns, words and phrases used are actually derived from vernacular expressions that originated in various English-speaking countries. The trend in the use of vernacular English has significantly increased due to the influx of mass media, as well as the prominence of social media. As a result, the way we communicate has taken on a much more fast-paced informality than previous generations.

Introducing Vernacular English

So, what makes vernacular English different from the standard version of the language? Firstly, the grammar and syntax of vernacular English makes use of abbreviations, contractions and cloze tests. For example “gonna” is the short form of “going to” and “wanna” is the short form of “want to”. Some examples of contractions include “can’t” for “cannot” and “should’ve” for “should have”. To make use of a cloze test, an individual takes a sentence and inserts a blank space in place of the missing word, then attempts to guess the suitable word.

Vernacular English is also defined by its non-standard pronunciation and accents, particularly within certain areas. Different areas of the country, as well as abroad, unlocks regional prints that not only add color to the language but can also be amusing, too. For instance, in the Southern United States, fried chicken may be called “fry-chicken” which incorporates a unique dialect. Furthermore, if someone from the Northeast was to pronounce the word “bagel” to someone from the Southwestern region of the United States, they would likely pronounce it like “bay-gul” instead of “bagel”.

Vernacular English and Conversation

Vernacular English is commonly known to play a large role in both oral and written language. When spoken, the language provides a unique combination of informal colloquialisms and slang. The people that most often utilize vernacular language are mostly those who are not natural born speakers of the language, or those with an informal education. Everyday casual conversations between people utilize this ‘conversational English’ as well. This is especially seen in school settings, where conversing students may use a mixture of standard English with colloquialisms.

Additionally, vernacular English is often used in literature, music, films, television shows, stand-up comedy and more. In literature, some examples of famous authors who have written using vernacular English are James Joyce and Mark Twain. For those not acquainted with the vernacular, reading literature in the genre can often prove amusing and confusing all at once. Furthermore, musicians will often incorporate vernacular words into the titles or lyrics of their songs. The most popular example of this can be found in hip-hop and rap music. Finally, as far as televised media is concerned, vernacular English is often employed in various sitcoms and cartoons to provide a humorous effect.

Vernacular English and the Education System

Although vernacular English usage has risen surrounding the school setting, it is not yet part of the English curriculum taught to children. This is especially true for those in middle and high schools. It is still shameful to utilize the language in the classroom and teachers often work hard to argue against it in order to maintain the educational standard. English teachers must fought against day-to-day sloppiness in casual conversations between their students while simultaneously trying to express the importance of maintaining educational standards of English.

Yet, as the world changes and global interaction increases, it is essential for teachers to acknowledge the prominence of vernacular language and find ways to integrate it into their English curriculum. This may involve introducing various vernacular English texts and audiobooks or incorporating the language in smaller Language Arts projects. The aim of such an initiative would be to encourage students to think outside ofthe box and to understand how proper English, when used in an informal setting, can be equally as beneficial as a transformative tool.

Conclusion

Vernacular English is a non-standard, modernized form of the language that incorporates slang, contractions, and regional accents in the words and phrases that are spoken or written. Although its prominence has been on the rise for some time, its usage remains largely confined to casual conversation and leisure activity. Vernacular English has yet to make its way into the standard educational curriculum, but there is hope that its increasing prevalence will encourage teachers to find innovative ways to implement these modernized dialects in the academic setting. With a greater understanding of the language, educators can help students become more proficient in their native tongue, while also making them aware of the importance of adhering to its educational normative.
