Led by vocalist and guitarist Lou Reed, the band's unconventional sound was a combination of experimental rock, blues, pop, and folk, influenced heavily by contemporary avant-garde and minimalism. The Velvet Underground has been described as one of the most influential, if not the most influential, alternative rock bands of all time.

The Velvet Underground was formed in 1965 by Reed and John Cale, a multi-instrumentalist whose musical palette was as wide-ranging as Reed's. Cale had previously played in The Primitives, a British R&B/blues band, and was inspired by the European avant-garde sound of minimalist composers such as La Monte Young and John Cage. With the addition of guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker, the band began to incorporate elements of experimental rock and jazz fusion into their sound.

The Velvet Underground's debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico, was released in 1967. The album was named after its featured vocalist, Nico, a German-born singer-songwriter whose icy vocals provided a stark contrast to the baroque lyricism of Reed's songs. The album was a critical and commercial failure upon release, but it has since become a much-acclaimed and influential classic, widely seen as a pioneering example of avant-garde and alternative rock. The Velvet Underground's sound was characterized by a tension between beauty and noise, combining unconventional structures, drones, and discordant guitar riffs with lush melodies and pop hooks.

The Velvet Underground's second album, White Light/White Heat, was released in 1968. Its heavy, distorted sound had been influenced by the emerging psychedelic rock scene, and the album showed the band stretching their sound even farther into the avant-garde. White Light/White Heat remains one of Reed's most acclaimed albums, earning accolades for its experimental approach and for its strong influence on later punk and alternative music.

The Velvet Underground's third album, The Velvet Underground, was released in 1969. It marked the band's move in a more pop-oriented direction, featuring shorter, more conventional songs in place of the extended avant-garde soundscapes of their earlier material. The Velvet Underground marked Reed's first collaboration with producer Bob Ezrin, who would continue to work with the band on their final two albums.

The Velvet Underground's fourth album, Loaded, was released in 1970 and marked the band's departure from both their avant-garde sound and their record label, Verve. Loaded was recorded over one month and was much more pop-oriented than their earlier records, due in part to Ezrin's production style and to the band's increasing interest in pursuing a mainstream audience. The album featured several of the band's most enduring songs, such as "Sweet Jane," "Rock & Roll," and "Oh! Sweet Nuthin'."

The Velvet Underground's final album, Squeeze, was released in 1973. The album featured a more diverse sound range than their earlier material, as Reed and Cale experimented with genres from reggae to funk to jazz. Despite the album's artistic merits, it was a commercial failure, leading to the band's dissolution shortly after its release.

Though the Velvet Underground never attained mass popular success, they exerted a profound influence on the shape of popular music in the decades to come. Their pioneering approach to alternative rock and avant-garde soundscapes inspired countless musicians, paving the way for the punk and alternative rock of the 1970s and 1980s. The Velvet Underground defied expectations and blurred boundaries, leaving a legacy of innovation that continues to inspire musicians to this day.
