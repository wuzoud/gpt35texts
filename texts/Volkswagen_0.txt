It has been around since 1937, and have seen ups and downs over the span of its almost 80 years of existence. But however Volkswagen got to its current level, this brand and its cars remain distinctive, with a signature look and feel.

The history of Volkswagen is associated with its founder, Ferdinand Porsche. During the early 1930s, the “people’s car” project, or "Volkswagen" as it was originally called, was taking place in Nazi Germany. It was the Nazis dream to create a car that was affordable for the average German, and so the Volkswagen Type 1 was created. This model was the very first car to be produced under the Volkswagen name, and it saw instant success due to its practicality and affordability. The Beetle, or also known as the Type 1, was then exported to other countries, and quickly became one of the most iconic cars in the world.

The Beetle is probably the most recognizable Volkswagen of all time. But the company did not stop innovating there. It has released numerous other models, such as the Golf, the Jetta, the Passat, the Tiguan, the Toureg, the Arteon, and the Atlas. All of these cars have further solidified Volkswagen's position in the automotive industry.

The Volkswagens of today are known for their sleek design, which has remained largely unchanged since the Beetle first came out. The cars are commonly seen sporting a black, white and silver color scheme, and the Beetle has become so iconic that it is often used as a fun image for marketing campaigns or as a cute design element in decor.

But Volkswagen is more than just trendy cars. It is a company built on a foundation of innovation and technology. For decades, they have been pushing the boundaries of what a car should be, and the modern Volkswagens are no exception. Today’s models come equipped with some of the most advanced motor technology on the road. This is evident in their standard infotainment systems, advanced safety features, and advanced parking systems.

Volkswagen makes a wide range of vehicles, from compact cars to luxury SUVs. Some of their most popular models include the Golf, the Jetta, the Passat, and the Atlas. And for those looking for something unique, there is the Arteon, a four-door coupe that features modern styling and a luxurious interior. For drivers looking for a more performance-oriented ride, Volkswagen offers the GTI and R models, both of which come with powerful engines and aggressive styling.

No matter what kind of car you are looking for, Volkswagen has something for everyone. The company has been around for almost 80 years and has established itself as one of the most iconic names in the automotive world. Its cars have seen success all over the world, and Volkswagen will continue to push the boundaries of automotive technology and design. With Volkswagen, you know you are getting quality and sophistication every time.
