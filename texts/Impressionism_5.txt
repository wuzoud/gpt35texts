Its primary focus was to create paintings that captured the essence and effects of light and movement on everyday subjects. This movement marked a significant shift from the traditional forms of painting that were dominant at the time. It was considered a radical departure from the academic style of the Salon and was largely criticized by the art establishment. However, Impressionism revolutionized the art world and had a lasting impact on the development of modern art.

The term “Impressionism” was first used in a derogatory manner by the art critic Louis Leroy after he saw Claude Monet’s painting “Impression, sunrise” at the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. The name stuck, and it was adopted by the group of artists who participated in the exhibition, including Monet, Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. These artists shared a common goal of capturing fleeting moments and sensations through their paintings.

At its core, Impressionism was a reaction to the strict rules and techniques of the traditional art academies. The Salon, which was the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris, was the most prestigious platform for artists to showcase their work. The Salon favored historical and mythological scenes, which were executed with a high level of detail and precision. This academic style of painting was heavily influenced by the Renaissance and Baroque periods and focused on idealized figures and perfectly balanced compositions.

In contrast, the Impressionists rejected these traditional rules and techniques and sought to depict the world around them as they saw it. They were greatly inspired by the advances in science and technology of the 19th century, particularly the development of photography. The invention of the camera allowed for a more accurate and instantaneous capture of everyday scenes, freeing artists from the burden of realistic depiction. This gave them the freedom to experiment with new techniques and styles.

One of the defining characteristics of Impressionism is the use of thin, broken brushstrokes of pure, unmixed colors. This technique, known as “en plein air” or painting outdoors, was a radical departure from the traditional method of painting in a studio. By working directly from nature, the Impressionists were able to capture the changing effects of light, shadows, and movement, which added an element of spontaneity and freshness to their paintings. This also allowed them to capture the colors and hues that were often overlooked in traditional painting techniques.

Moreover, the Impressionists were also known for their rejection of the use of black in their paintings. Instead, they used a wide range of vibrant colors to create depth and form in their work. This was a huge departure from the realism and subdued colors of the traditional academic paintings, and it was seen as shockingly modern at the time. The use of bright, pure colors also gave their paintings a luminous quality, making them appear to glow and vibrate.

Another distinctive feature of Impressionist paintings is the capturing of everyday, mundane subject matter. While traditional academic art focused on grand, historical or mythological themes, the Impressionists depicted scenes from everyday life – landscapes, cityscapes, portraits, and still life. They were particularly interested in the effects of light and atmosphere on their subjects, and thus, their paintings often portrayed the same scene at different times of the day to show the changing effects of light and shadows. This emphasis on everyday subjects was considered radical at the time, but it gave a sense of realism and relatability to their work.

In addition to painting outdoors, the Impressionists also experimented with new painting techniques, such as using a limited palette, visible brushstrokes, and unconventional compositions. The technique of using a limited palette refers to the use of a small number of colors in a painting, which creates a harmonious and unified overall effect. Meanwhile, visible brushstrokes were used to create texture and movement in their paintings, showcasing the artist's hand and individuality. These techniques contributed to the impression of immediacy and spontaneity, which became synonymous with Impressionist art.

Apart from their unique painting techniques, the Impressionists also had a distinct approach to composition. They often cropped their subjects in unconventional ways, leaving out parts of the subject or completely omitting them from the painting. This unconventional approach to composition gave a sense of naturalness to their work, as if the viewer was getting a glimpse of a moment in time rather than a perfectly composed scene.

The Impressionists also had a profound impact on the role of the artist in society. While traditional academic painters were seen as highly skilled craftsmen, the Impressionists viewed themselves as creators and innovators. They rejected the idea of being confined to the academic ideals of beauty and instead focused on capturing their own personal impressions of the world around them. This shift in mindset led to the recognition of artists as individuals with their own unique vision, and it paved the way for future artistic movements.

Despite being a departure from the traditional art world, Impressionism gained popularity among the public and sparked a new interest in art. This was mostly due to the highly successful exhibitions organized by the Impressionists themselves, which allowed them to showcase their work directly to the public. These exhibitions were seen as a rebellion against the Salon and its strict rules, and they garnered a lot of attention and curiosity from the public.

However, the Impressionists faced severe criticism from art critics and the art establishment. Their work was often deemed unfinished, with a lack of detail and blurry forms. At the time, the use of vibrant colors and visible brushstrokes was seen as immature and unrefined. Many critics also found the scenes depicted by the Impressionists to be too common and unattractive. However, despite the initial skepticism from the art world, the Impressionists continued to push the boundaries and gained a strong following of admirers.

The movement had a significant influence on the art world of the time and paved the way for other artistic movements, such as Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism. The Impressionists challenged the conventions of traditional art and brought forth a new way of looking at the world through art. Their paintings captured the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere, and their use of pure, unmixed colors and visible brushstrokes gave a sense of spontaneity and originality to their work.

Even today, Impressionism remains one of the most influential art movements in history. Its impact can be seen in various art forms, from painting and sculpture to music and literature. The movement continues to inspire new generations of artists, who are drawn to its emphasis on individual expression and capturing the beauty of everyday life. The legacy of Impressionism lives on, and its revolutionary approach to portraying the world continues to fascinate and captivate audiences worldwide.
