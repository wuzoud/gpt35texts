Experts believe the tarot can provide insight to our innermost thoughts and feelings, and be used for self-improvement and spiritual growth. In this article, we will explore the history and origin of tarot cards, as well as provide an overview of how to use them confidently and effectively.

Origins of Tarot Cards

The earliest roots of the Tarot date back to 15th century Italy where decks of cards with images and symbols were used for gaming and socializing. Tarot cards evolved from these decks of cards, staging from an unknown origin about 400 years ago. The most widely accepted origin of these cards comes from a 14th century Golden Dawnistic cabalistic order that is said to have created the first modern tarot deck.

The major arcana consist of 22 cards representing the spiritual journey of life while minors arcana consist of 56 cards with characters like Page, Knight, Queen, and King. Each card contains its own individual symbolism and messages, allowing users to make intuitive and powerful connections.

The Meaning of Tarot Cards

Tarot cards are often used to gain insight into an individual’s life and to reveal potential futures. Many people believe that the tarot is a form of divination—a practice of predicting the future by interpreting signs, symbols, and messages—or that it has some deeper spiritual meaning. In truth, tarot cards are simply a set of symbols that can be interpreted subjectively—depending on the reader in the moment—to provide greater understanding of inner feelings and dilemmas.

In simplest terms, a tarot deck consists of 78 cards divided into two categories: the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards featuring archetypal images such as The Hermit, The Chariot, and The Lovers, and each card carries its own meaning and interpretation. The Minor Arcana consists of 56 cards divided into suits, like Pentacles, Wands, Cups, and Swords. These cards carry a representation of everyday life, including a range of emotions, relationships, and positive and negative experiences. Each suit in the Minor Arcana has its own card values, such as Ace, Two, and Three, and variations on this theme depending on the deck.

How to Read Tarot Cards

When using the tarot, you will need to first identify what kind of reading you want to do. There are many different techniques and meanings for tarot cards, and the cards can either be read individually or combined together as a series or pattern. It’s important to understand the basic meaning of the cards and to use that as a starting point to interpret readings.

Once you have decided which type of reading you are going to do, it’s time to shuffle the deck and begin. Ask yourself a question, such as “what will help me overcome this challenge in my life?” Shuffle the deck and draw seven cards, then lay them out face up in a horizontal row. Begin interpreting each card according to its position in the row and its relations to the others.

The best way to interpret the tarot is to follow your intuition. When traditionally interpreting tarot cards, readers often turn to numerology and astrology for additional insight. Yet it’s important to remember that the tarot is largely symbolic, which means there’s no single fixed interpretation. This makes it the perfect tool for self-reflection and introspection.

Tips for Reading Tarot Cards

Tarot readings can be performed with relative ease, though at the same time there are a few key points to remember. Here are some tips to take into consideration when using tarot cards.

• Keep an open mind and trust your intuition—Don’t let preconceived notions or fear cloud your judgement. Allow yourself to be led by your intuition as you read the cards.

• Respect the cards and their power—tarot cards weren’t designed to predict the future, nor were they meant to provide instant answers. Instead, consider them a useful means of gaining insight into life’s difficult questions.

• Beginners should try to keep readings simple—Although experienced readers may connect multiple tarot cards together to form patterns and stories, it’s best for beginners to focus on one card at a time. That way, you can fully explore and interpret its meaning.

• Always interpret the cards as they relate to you—When interpreting the tarot, it’s important to remember that each card’s individual meaning and interpretation will vary depending on the individual reader. Rather than letting your mind wander to pre-existing meanings, always focus on the cards’ messages as they relate to your life and your current situation.
