Consisting of at least 25 sub-branches, the Germanic branch comprises German, Dutch, English, Afrikaans, Yiddish, Frisian, Scandinavian, and Low German (spoken in several dialects), as well as a number of extinct and threatened languages. This spectrum of closely related languages can be traced back to Proto-Germanic, the reconstructed ancestor language of most of Europe’s vernaculars.

The Germanic language family has its roots in the ancient languages known as Proto-Indo-European (PIE). According to the generally accepted hypothesis, PIE was spoken around 4500 BCE in the region of the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. This ancient tongue began to divide and diverge within a number of its speakers’ distinct dialects around the year 2500 BCE, breaking down into proto-Germanic – and later Germanic itself. This proto-Germanic language was eventually spread over much of Central and Western Europe, although its boundaries were constantly changing. It had considerable influence on the adjacent Romance languages which began to form in the south of Europe during the same period.

Proto-Germanic, the ancient ancestor of all of the modern Germanic languages, was spoken until roughly the 5th century CE. While some surviving dialects from this period are still known today, the majority of these ancient languages have been lost. Such endangered languages include Old Prussian, Old Gutnish, Burgundian, Old High German, and Old English or Anglo-Saxon.

Today’s Germanic language family can be divided into two principle branches: West Germanic and North Germanic. The West Germanic family includes German, Dutch, Frisian, and English within its umbrella. English is often classified as a West Germanic language due to its vocabulary and grammar, which share many traits with other West Germanic languages. It’s also the most widely spoken of all West Germanic languages.

In stark contrast to English’s status as a world language, German is the native language of only two countries, Germany and Austria. For this reason, German is mainly referred to as a “local” language. However, German also enjoys a special status as an official language in the countries of Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein. Moreover, German is believed to be the mother tongue of over 100 million people worldwide, due largely to the significant amount of German immigration to the United States and other countries in the mid-to-late 19th century.

Dutch is less commonly spoken than German, with the Dutch language having just over 23 million native speakers spread across the Netherlands and large portions of Belgium and the Dutch Antilles. Dutch is overall a low-prestige language, which is in part due to its socio-economic status – the Netherlands is by and large a socially liberal, free-market economy and is the second most prosperous country in the world (as of 2020).

Frisian is perhaps the least-known Germanic language. It is, however, an official language in the Netherlands as well as in certain parts of Germany. It is spoken by roughly half a million people.

The North Germanic branch of the Germanic family can be further divided into two distinct language groups: East Scandinavian and West Scandinavian. East Scandinavian, which contains Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian, is more closely related to the Nynorsk language group (an amalgam of various dialects of Norwegian). West Scandinavian encompasses Icelandic, Faroese, and the Finnish languages (although the latter is technically only distantly related to the other Germanic languages).

Swedish is the largest and probably most well-known of the Scandinavian languages, with over 10 million native speakers. Swedish is the official language of Sweden, Finland, and the autonomous provinces of northern Sweden, and is an official minority language in also Estonia. Danish is spoken by approximately 5 million people and is the official language of Denmark, with a presence in the Faroe Islands (a territory of Denmark) and southern Schleswig-Holstein (a state in Germany). Finally, Norwegian has over 4 million native speakers. It holds the official language status in Norway, as well as in certain parts of the United States, and is closely related to Danish.

The Germanic languages are generally characterized by their complex, highly inflected grammar, and especial forms of pronouns, articles, and verb conjugations. Put simply, these languages are characterized by their large number of verb declensions. Furthermore, many of the modern Germanic languages were profoundly affected by the Early and Late Modern English period. During this time, the use of French terms and syntax within English was commonplace, which resulted in the mixing of the two language families – commonly known as “Anglo-Norman” – resulting in the Englishes spoken today.

During the course of the late 19th century, the Germanic languages were heavily influenced by the spread of the High German consonant shift, originating in south-west Germany and converting Old Germanic languages into a particular form of modern German. This shift, in time, also gave rise to the West Germanic languages.

The Germanic languages, from past to present, have played a significant role in the spread of vocabulary, culture, and civilizations across the world. Today, they remain some of the most widely spoken languages on Earth, with billions understanding, speaking, or learning at least one of these languages. Therefore, no matter how much they may differ from each other linguistically, the Germanic languages are undeniably part of our shared cultural heritage.
