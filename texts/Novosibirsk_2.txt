It is the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast and the Siberian Federal District. The city is an important educational and scientific center, and is home to over 1.5 million inhabitants, many of whom are employed in a variety of research institutions and high-tech industries. 

Novosibirsk was founded in 1893, as the administrative center of the Turkestan-Siberian Railway (now Siberskaya Railway). Scientists, engineers, and workers made the city a hub of development. Over its long history, Novosibirsk has seen rapid growth as well as economic decline, and is now an important economic center in Russia and one of the most important cities in Siberia. 

Novosibirsk has been called the "capital of the Siberian region" due to its population and its role as the regional hub for education, culture, economy, and industry. Its modern infrastructure is the result of rapid economic growth in recent years. The city is full of newly built skyscrapers, and high rise buildings, yet it also has a rich history.

Novosibirsk lies in the middle of Siberia's vast landscape. The oblast's principal rivers - the Ob and the Irtysh - converge near the city. The city's location provides many opportunities that could not be found in other Siberian cities. There is a large selection of parks and woods, and the city's proximity to the river has given rise to a number of interesting sites for birdwatching and ecotourism. 

The city itself is known for its diversity. In addition to Russians, the population of Novosibirsk is made up of Ukrainians, Tatars, Germans, Korean and Chinese immigrants. This mixture of nationalities has created a unique culture and given the city a dynamic atmosphere. Novosibirsk’s culture is often referred to as "Siberian cosmopolitanism."

Novosibirsk is renowned for its outstanding infrastructure and its impressive educational and scientific facilities. The largest university in Siberia is based here, Novosibirsk State University, as well as several colleges and institutes. Novosibirsk is also home to the Russian Academy of Sciences. At the Koltsovo Scientific Town near Novosibirsk, the world-famous Koltsovo International Science Center is situated, supporting numerous research institutes and laboratories that specialize in nuclear physics, high-energy physics, and biochemistry.

Novosibirsk's industrial sector is very diverse. The city's largest employer, Novosibirsk electromechanical factory, produces heavy machinery and industrial products. There are also wood and paper industries, food processing, and, due to its high concentration of scientists, many research institutions and high-tech companies. Novosibirsk is becoming increasingly important as a transport junction, as it has well-developed railway, highway, and air connections to other parts of Russia.
