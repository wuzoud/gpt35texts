It is the language spoken on a day-to-day basis by the members of these communities, rather than a formal, educationally recognized language, such as standard English. Vernacular English is sometimes seen as the dialect or variety of English that is most representative of a certain region or area.

Vernacular English is one of the oldest forms of human communication. It is thought to have been present in many cultures since pre-history. Origins of vernacular English can be traced back to the languages of the indigenous populations of North America, Africa, and Europe as far back as the 1500s. The term "Vernacular English" was first used in the 1950s to refer to the type of English spoken in certain regions of Britain, such as Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and parts of England. From this time on, the term vernacular English has been used to discuss language in general and to refer to particular regional varieties of English in specific.

Although vernacular English can differ significantly in vocabulary, pronunciation, and even grammar from standard English, it is considered to be the language of a particular region. Vernacular English is often seen as a way to express local culture and identity. It is considered to be the language that most deeply reflects the values, attitudes, and beliefs which are found in a certain locale. Vernacular English has been argued to express complex cultural knowledge in ways that standard English simply cannot. The importance of maintaining vernacular English is often seen as paramount for preserving certain aspects of local culture and identity.

The importance of maintaining vernacular English is often argued for its ability to help individuals connect with their local community. The boundaries which separate different language varieties ensure that vernacular English remains the language of the local community instead of becoming standardized English. It preserves the local history of a certain place, conveys shared values, beliefs, and emotions, and strengthens the sense of local identity. By speaking vernacular English, people can connect to their community and enjoy the kind of meaningful conversations that cannot be found in standardized English. In many cases, speaking vernacular English also acts as a source of pride, indicating a shared understanding and appreciation of local culture.

Although the variety of English most widely spoken in a region is considered to be vernacular English, it can also be argued that it is not the only language encountered in a certain locale. The various ethnic minority groups present in many modern societies bring their own language and dialects into local conversations. As a result, the sheer variety of languages encountered in a certain locale, and the distinct identities which they reflect, make it difficult to pinpoint the exact definition of vernacular English.

At the same time, there has been evidence that suggests that even in cases where the variety of English most commonly encountered in a certain region is standard English, its users can still be considered to speak in a form of vernacular English. People living in areas where a dominant form of standard English is spoken can still differ in terms of accents, pronunciation, and even grammatical rules. This could indicate that although the vocabulary and pronunciation used in certain regions may be identical to what is considered to be standard English, people may still have subtle variations in the way they express themselves in their everyday conversations. Therefore, the term vernacular English could still be used, albeit with slight modifications, to characterize the language of any region.

The various forms of vernacular English seen in different parts of the world demonstrate the diversity that exists in terms of language and usage. Vernacular English may vary significantly from one region to another, depending on the various cultural, social, and economic factors which impact language usage in any given place. Its existence, however, serves as a reminder that the conversations between people in different regions are unique and contribute to the richness of the English language. Therefore, the importance of respecting and maintaining the various dialects and varieties of vernacular English should not be ignored.
