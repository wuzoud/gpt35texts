Peter Parker, secretly known as Spiderman, is a regular teenager who becomes a superhero after being bitten by a radioactive spider. With great power comes great responsibility, and Peter has answered that call with courage and a sense of justice.

Spiderman first made his debut in Marvel Comics' Amazing Fantasy #15 in 1962, created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. From the very beginning, Spiderman was an instant hit, as readers flocked to the amazing adventures of a teenage superhero. While his powers did not include flying or superhuman strength, Spiderman's agility, his ability to cling to walls, and his use of "web shooters" that shoot chemical "webs" made him a unique and lovable character.

Unlike most other superheroes, Spiderman has no superhuman flaws; his strength is his human nature. His personal struggles with responsibility and power, paired with his warm personality and consistent moral code, make him an ideal role model. Spiderman's origin story has become legendary among fans, with his life-changing experience of understanding the importance of and using his powers for good, particularly when no one else is around to do it.

As the years have gone by, we have seen Spiderman in a variety of mediums, from comics to television programs, movies, and even video games. In each version, Peter is portrayed as the same hardworking, teenager with a “geek” attitude, who has unwavering convictions and the courage to stand up against evil. He is also a devoted crimefighter who never hesitates to take responsibility for protecting the innocent.

At his heart, Spiderman is a hero, one that uses his wit as well as his strength to overpower his enemies. He is willing to put himself in danger, often taking dangerous risks, to make sure that those who cannot defend themselves are safe.

Spiderman has enjoyed a variety of foes throughout his adventures. His archenemy, Doctor Octopus, has proven to be a powerful adversary, as well as a mentally unstable killer–villain. He is constantly challenging Spiderman, pushing him to use the best of his abilities, and allowing Spiderman to really explore his powers. Other foes from Spiderman's rogues gallery include the Green Goblin, Venom, Sandman, and Electro.

Spiderman movies and shows have become hugely popular over the years, spawning sequels, spin-offs, and even an entire universe of characters and stories. He's appeared in films like Sam Raimi's Spiderman Trilogy and the 2013 reboot The Amazing Spiderman, as well as a variety of animated series, including Spider-Man: The Animated Series, The Spectacular Spider-Man, and the Ultimate Spiderman Series.

Spiderman is a complex character with a complicated past, and his many adventures provide us with inspiring stories of courage, justice, and responsibility. He may never fly, punch his way through walls, or save the world from imminent doom every week, but Spiderman is proof that an ordinary person can be a great hero. His dedication to protecting the innocent lives of others is ever present, and his constant trials remind us of the importance of doing what is right now matter what. For these reasons, Spiderman has become one of the most popular and powerful heroes of our lifetime.
