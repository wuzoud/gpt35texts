Volkswagen is one of the largest automakers in the world, having sold more than 10 million vehicles in 2019 alone. Founded in 1937 in Germany, Volkswagen (also known as VW) has come a long way since its humble beginnings as an automobile manufacturer with limited technology. Defaulting on its debt during the economic crisis of the late 1940s, the company was rescued by the German government, thus beginning its journey towards becoming one of the most successful and recognizable vehicle brands on the planet.

The early Volkswagen models made use of the same air-cooled, rear-engined and rear-wheel drive platform that was developed by Ferdinand Porsche, under the order of Adolf Hitler. Inferring on Hitler’s mission to bring motoring to the German masses, the company had a clever advertising campaign involving a cartoon character known as the "Beetle" which was derived from the German word for Volkswagen, "Käfer". Towards the end of the second world war, Volkswagen was the only major automobile manufacturer in Germany that was not destroyed, allowing for further models to emerge that eventually caught the attention of the international market.

Perhaps the most famous of all the Volkswagen models was the iconic Beetle, made famous by its advertising campaigns that said “Think Small.” The Volkswagen Beetle went on to sell over five million units worldwide and, while production ceased in 2003, it still remains the longest-running and most manufactured car of a single platform ever. In addition to the Beetle, Volkswagen also has produced a wide range of vehicles over the years, including the iconic scarf-wearing microbus, the majestic Phaeton, and the modern-day luxury Touareg.

In the late 1980s, Volkswagen began to acquire auto companies around the world, including Audi, SEAT, Skoda, and Bentley, in an effort to become one of the largest automakers in the world. Through this process, Volkswagen developed additional engines and platforms, most of which are shared across nearly all its brands. It currently makes more than 30 different vehicles and models throughout the world.

In addition to its automobile production, Volkswagen has ventured into manufacturing a wide range of products and services, including solar energy systems, motorcycles, light electric vehicles, and car sharing services. The company’s subsidiaries and divisions are present in 125 countries and 6 continents, making it one of the most recognizable and innovative companies in the world.

More recently, Volkswagen has taken a major leap into one of the most important markets in the automotive world—electric vehicles. Volkswagen has announced its intentions for going all-electric with its recently launched ID range of vehicles, specifically targeting the mass-market customer. The ID range of cars includes four different models, with plans to introduce two more models by the end of 2020. Volkswagen has made a commitment to the environment by investing more than $40 billion into the development of electric vehicles by 2022, with the intent to create a 100% electric vehicle lineup by 2030.

As a company, Volkswagen prides itself on providing innovative and reliable vehicles to its customers. Through its long history, Volkswagen has become one of the most recognized and successful brands in the automobile industry, producing cars that are not only backed by quality, but also by decades of experience and expertise. Although the company is often associated with its classic Beetle, it has also innovated its offerings across its expansive range, making Volkswagen one of the most popular automakers known to man.
