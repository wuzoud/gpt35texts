McDonald’s is one of the biggest and most recognizable companies in the world, and it all began when two brothers, Dick and Mac McDonald, opened a small drive-in barbecue restaurant in San Bernardino, California. The brothers wanted to serve quick and tasty food at a reasonable price, and so they began to specialize in just hamburgers, french fries and milkshakes. In 1948 the brothers opened a second restaurant and developed their first franchise, the beginning of a multi-billion dollar international enterprise.
