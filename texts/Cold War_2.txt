It was a conflict of words and action between the United States and the Soviet Union and their allies. While ‘cold’ in name, the war was very much a ‘hot’ war with a range of proxy wars fought all over the world. It left indelible marks on world history and drastically changed the way the world is today.

The roots of the Cold War extend to World War II, where for the first time two very different world powers were competing for control of Europe and much of the world. At the time, Soviet communism and American democracy clashed openly in the political and military arenas. The Soviet Union formed an iron curtain around Central Europe and the Iron Curtain countries were considered behind the Soviet Union's “sphere of influence.”

In response to the Soviet sphere of influence, the United States worked to create a balance of power. This included the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1948 to counter the Soviet Union's Warsaw Pact. The United States also formed the Marshall Plan to provide economic aid to help Western Europe recover after the war. This was seen by communist countries of Eastern Europe as the United States trying to interfere in their internal affairs.

The Cold War was also immediately apparent in the nuclear arms race and the space race. Both the United States and the Soviet Union wanted to be the world leaders in technology, and developed nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in a race to outpace each other. This was a massive competition that only ended when the United States won the moon race in 1969.

The Cold War was also apparent in the fact that both the United States and the Soviet Union were vying for influence around the world. Both countries had their allies and both countries used the Cold War as a way to extend their influence. In many places, the Cold War led to proxy wars, which were indirect wars between two powers. The most notable of these proxy wars were in Korea and Vietnam. In Korea, the United States and its allies fought against the Communist forces of North Korea and China, while in Vietnam the United States fought North Vietnam and its allies. These wars, as well as other proxy wars around the world, were an example of the Cold War spilling out onto the international stage.

The Cold War also shaped the culture of the world. In some countries, citizens were encouraged to form youth groups and programs to prepare for war, while in other countries, ideological differences were entrenched and led to the formation of “Axis” and “Allied” camps. In the United States and the Soviet Union, a cultural divide was reinforced between the two countries and even within their own borders.

The Cold War came to an end with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, yet it left its mark on the global geopolitical landscape. In Western countries, fears of communists and totalitarianism have largely subsided. The international system has become much more diverse and much more cooperative. Countries which were part of the Iron Curtain are now independent democracies, open to the world.

The Cold War, while still a painful part of history, has also been a lesson on the power of diplomacy and the value of global cooperation. By understanding the lessons of the Cold War, it is possible to have a better understanding of our current conflicts and to find solutions which bring about peace and stability. It is for this reason that the study of the Cold War is still relevant today and should not be forgotten.
