Alaska is the largest state of the United States, occupying the northwest corner of the continent while stretching from the Arctic Circle to the Bering Sea. Referred to as “The Last Frontier,” Alaska is unlike any other state in the union, offering vast expanses of untouched wilderness, incredible outdoor recreational opportunities, and an abundance of wildlife. It is the most northern and western state in the nation, and the least densely populated, making it an incredible destination for adventure.

Here, you can experience the true essence of the wilds, and find yourself in awe of the vast natural beauty that the state of Alaska has to offer.

The history of Alaska is rich and filled with unique culture. Alaska has been home to Indigenous Peoples for thousands of years. The term “Alaska” is derived from an Aleut word, “aláxsxaq”, meaning “greatland”. European explorers traveled to Alaska in the late 1700s, and in 1867 it was officially purchased from Russia by the United States. From the gold rush of the late 1800s to the building of the Alaska Railroad in the early 1900s, development in Alaska has been filled with moments of great accomplishment.

Alaska is known for its dramatic weather, with mild summers, cold winters, and periods of rain and snowfall. Home to four unique climates, Alaska offers adventure seekers a diverse array of outdoor activities. During the warmer months, bird watching, boating, fishing, and hiking are just a few activities that await you in Alaska’s wilds. In the winter months, skiing, snowmobiling and snowshoeing are available. No matter the time of year, Alaska offers breathtaking views that can be reached off the beaten path or on the well-established trails and highways.

Alaska is also home to an astounding variety of wildlife, including moose, eagles, bears, salmon, walrus, beluga whales, and caribou to name just a few. Alaska’s wildlife is an important part of the culture and helps to sustain the local economy through hunting, fishing, tourism, and ecotourism. Whether seen in the wild or in one of the state’s many zoos and aquariums, observing the creatures of the “last frontier” is an incredible experience.
