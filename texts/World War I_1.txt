World War I began in the summer of 1914, when a young Serbian revolutionary assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. This was the trigger for a long series of events that escalated into a continent-wide conflict involving some of the most powerful countries on earth at the time. At the start of the war, the warring parties included the Entente Powers of the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and others, as well as the Central Powers of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey. The war quickly spread to the colonies of these countries and drew in the United States.

The war saw a number of technological advances in weaponry, most notably the introduction of the tank, machine guns, and chemical weapons—such as chlorine and phosgene gas, which would both be used at the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and during the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917. This war, along with the First World War, saw an increase in the use of air power, particularly through the use of bombers and zeppelins, which took a heavy toll on civilians during the war.

The war primarily took place on the Western Front, with other battlefields such as the Somme, Verdun, and the Marne. These battlefields became infamous for the terrible losses in human life and the horrific scenes that were witnessed. India, Africa, and the Middle East all saw extensive fighting during this time, as well as the naval battle of Jutland, which was one of the most significant naval battles of the war, and the Battle of the Atlantic, which saw intense submarine warfare between Allied ships and U-boats.

The United States joined the war in 1917 and sent a large number of troops to the trenches. This intervention played a major role in the ultimate victory of the Allies, and the American forces also brought with them the weapons and technological advances that hadn't been seen before.

The war finally ended in 1918 with the armistice that was signed between Germany and the Allies in the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. The terms of the armistice included the end of German occupation in the conquered territories and the return of all captured prisoners.

Although the war was over, its terrible impact was keenly felt around the world. Millions of people had been killed or wounded, entire agricultural systems had been destroyed, cities and towns had been razed to the ground, and the political and economic systems in Europe had been completely disrupted. The world had been changed forever by the conflict, and its reverberations would continue to be felt in the decades ahead.

World War I had a profound and lasting impact on many aspects of the world. Many technological advances were made during the war, which would shape the course of future wars to come. It saw an unprecedented mobilization of people from all corners of the globe, and numerous advances in tactics and technology. At the same time, millions of people perished in the conflict, ushering in a devastating new era of warfare that would shape the world for years to come.
