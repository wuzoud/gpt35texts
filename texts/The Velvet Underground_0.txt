Their music is among some of the most influential of the twentieth century and their legacy still resonates throughout modern music today. From their formation in 1964 until their dissolution in 1973, The Velvet Underground contributed a lasting impression on popular music, influencing numerous genres such as punk, alternative, grunge, and indie rock.

Formed by songwriter Lou Reed, The Velvet Underground was established in New York City and quickly gained a wide variety of fans within the underground music scene. After playing in the band The Primitives, Reed was offered a contract by music producer Tom Wilson, who would become their first producer. Reed gathered together a group of musicians who would become part of The Velvet Underground. They were John Cale, a multi-instrumentalist and fellow former Primitive, as well as Sterling Morrison, bass player, and drummer, Maureen Tucker.

Their debut album, The Velvet Underground and Nico, was released in 1967 and featured the hit single, “All Tomorrow's Parties.” The album was well received and helped cement The Velvet Underground's place in the realm of influential music. Throughout their career they utilized a wide variety of sounds, structures, and styles. This included the use of drones, feedback loops, and experimental recording techniques.

The Velvet Underground's next album, White Light/White Heat, was released in 1968. This release was slightly different than their debut, as it showed a heavier, harsher sound. Throughout the rest of the 1960s and into the 1970s, The Velvet Underground released the albums The Velvet Underground, Loaded, and Squeeze. This period of albums moved away from the heavy sound of White Light/White Heat and instead focused on more melodic, psychedelic sounds.

The influence of The Velvet Underground is undeniable. Their brilliant fusion of experimental noise, freak folk, and pop culture made them one of the most unique bands of all time. They influenced generations of musicians across numerous genres, with bands such as Joy Division, Sonic Youth, and Talking Heads citing The Velvet Underground as a major influence on their work. The band's cult following and popularity continued to grow, and as a result, their albums remain some of the most sought after.
